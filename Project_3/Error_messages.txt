Everything below the line of dashes is a valid error message.
If an input is valid and you output one of these allowed error
messages, the autograder will show you the error message, which
will help you with debugging.  For example, you rejected a
valid input, thinking that timestamps decreased when they didn't.
If you receive that error message for a valid input, you know
where to start debugging.

You cannot have an execution date before the current timestamp.
